Any one from any background, non engineering, engineering  can also start on getting their hands on these technologies as it is just the matter of your dedication to learn anything new.
The main idea behind it is day by day technology is getting better (positive opinion) in order to make our lives easy. We as engineering to survive in IT industry really need to be upto date.
In today's world or in any company sometimes we need to work on technologies about which we never heard during our engineering course or were not provided practical on the job training.
Therefore it becomes very crucial to have full understanding about the technologies in which you are directly dealing with your customer or client.
